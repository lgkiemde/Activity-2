<h1><pre> Hi, My name is Lisa Kiemde.</pre></h1>
<p float = right;> I am a graduate student in MIS focusing in data analytics. I received a Bachelor's degree in 2016. My degree was in Secondary Math
Eduation. I realized that teaching, although rewarding, would not allow me to help my family in the way I thought they deserved to be cared for. 
I wanted to do something interesting and math related. Thus, MIS with a focus in data analytics was my main choice. MIS allows me to be considered
for managing positions where I can use my teaching skills to help others. Data analytics allows me to do math and think indepth about a problem. 
I am mom of a wonderful baby boy. I am a wife of a cool environmental engineer. I am the daughter of a scientist and a social worker. 
I am the sister of a computer scientist and a union organizer.

<h2> Goals for this Class </h2>
<p> The reason I am taking this class is not only because it is required, but it is also to gain skills I missed when transitioning from a 
Secondary Math Eduction to MIS. This will help me have another way to communicate with others in an effective way. It will give me the skills
to accomplish my future goals.
