        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">I am a graduate student in MIS focusing in data
            science. I received a Bachelor's degree in 2016. My degree was in Secondary Math
            Eduation. I realized that teaching, although rewarding, would not allow me to help
            my family in the way I thought they deserved to be cared for. It also did not hold
            my interest.</p>
