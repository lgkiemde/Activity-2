<h1><pre> Hi, My name is Lisa Kiemde.</pre></h1>
<p> I am a graduate student in MIS focusing in data
science. I received a Bachelor's degree in 2016. My degree was in Secondary Math
Eduation. I realized that teaching, although rewarding, would not allow me to help
my family in the way I thought they deserved to be cared for. It also did not hold
my interest. 
</p>

<h2> Goals for this Class </h2>
<p> My goals for this class is to learn skills that I missed with a Bachelor's in Math
 Education. I have only coded in HTML a few times before. I look forward to becoming more
confident and more comfortable in coding.
