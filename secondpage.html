    <h1>Interesting Research</h1>
    <p> I am interested in data justice as well as mobile health. While I enjoy learning 
    all subjects and seeing concepts from different prespectives, I especially like data
    justice and mobile health because it has the potential to help people. </p>

    <h2> Interests for this Class </h2>
    <p> My interests for this class mainly lies in the skills I will learn and be able to 
    add to my repertoire. I believe that I underestimate my coding skills and this will give
    me a chance to prove to myself that I can code and keep up with others who are soon to be
    IT professionals.
